In order to run this project, first run the `python manage.py migrate` command in order to first create the sqlite database. Next, run the server using the `python manage.py runserver` command and access the default url. This would populate all models in the first run and then would let the user switch between different theaters and search through different movie titles. In order to access the admin portal, use the `python manage.py createsuperuser` command to first create a new superuser and then access the `/admin/` url.
